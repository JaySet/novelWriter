#### Some Section

@char: Jane

This is a paragraph of nonsense text.

This is another paragraph
with a line separator in it.

This is another paragraph of much longer nonsense text. It is in fact 1 very very NONSENSICAL nonsense text! We can also try replacing “quotes”, even single ‘quotes’ are replaced. Isn’t that nice? We can hyphen-ate, make dashes – and even longer dashes — if we want. Ellipsis? Not a problem either … How about three hyphens — for long dash? It works too.

“Full line double quoted text.”

‘Full line single quoted text.’

Some “ double quoted text with spaces padded ”.

– Hi, I am a character speaking.

– Hi, I am also a character speaking, – said another character. – How are you?

@object: NoSpaceAdded

% synopsis : Space before this is OK.

%Footnote.abc : A simple footnote.

Add space before this colon : See?

But don’t add a double space : See?
